  # Placing the NAD in the default namespace makes it available cluster-wide
  # You can place NADs in other namespaces to make networks only available for workloads within that namespace
  # Other NADs for specialized segmentation such as for Live Migration or ODF will be placed in other namespaces such as openshift-cnv and openshift-storage respectively
  namespace: default
spec:
  # cniVersion is required and must be "0.3.1"
  # type is required and must be "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay"
  # topology is probably localnet unless you want a network internal to the cluster only with layer2
  # netAttachDefName is required and must be "$NS/$NAME" of this NAD...yep.
  # name is required and is the name of the bridge-mapping.localnet!
  # vlanID is optional
  # mtu is optional
  # subnets is the subnets for the IP address space that will be MANAGED BY OPENSHIFT!  If you want to use DHCP, you can omit this.
  # excludeSubnets is the same thing as subnets, but in inverse with the same terms applied.
